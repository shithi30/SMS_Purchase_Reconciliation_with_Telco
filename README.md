Bookkeeping app *TallyKhata* would use SMS services purchased from telco operators, for its users (mainly, shopkeepers) to send messages to their customers about payment of outstanding credit. This repo houses scripts to:
- Produce monthly SMS usage reports by 5 telco operators: *Grameen (Telenor Bangladesh), Robi, Mobireach, ADN, Banglalink*.
- Cross-validate telcos' billing reports with DWH's data and send results to the TechOps team, for OTP/transaction/credit SMS payments.

**Tech Stack:** Language - `Python` , DB & Wrappers - `Postgres, Psycopg2, SQLalchemy` , Email - `GSheets API, smtplib`<br><br>
